## Project Overview
- Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript coffee directory
- Supabase backend with complex schema
- 90% complete, needs data migration + bug fixes for launch
- Uses Zustand for state, TanStack Query for data fetching
- Custom component library built on shadcn/ui

## Critical Files to Always Consider
- src/types/supabase.ts (database types)
- src/lib/supabase/ (database connections)
- src/store/zustand/ (state management)
- src/styles/globals.css (design system)

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer server components over client components
- Use Zustand for complex state, useState for simple state
- Follow existing patterns in src/components/
- Never use localStorage in artifacts (not supported)
- Use proper error boundaries and loading states

## Database Schema Notes
- Roasters and coffees are main entities
- Many-to-many relationships via junction tables
- IP-based rating system (no auth required)
- Complex filter system with URL synchronization

## Common Patterns
- useSupabaseQuery for data fetching
- Zod schemas for validation
- TanStack Query for caching
- Custom hooks in src/hooks/
- Server actions in src/app/actions/

## Priority Focus
- Data migration from JSON files
- Filter system bug fixes
- Performance optimization for production
- SEO metadata completion
